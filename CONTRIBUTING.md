## Where to Start

Learn [how to contribute code on Github](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940).

If you're a developer looking to contribute, but you're not sure where to begin, check out the [good first issue](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieBotUI/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label on Github, which contains small tasks that have been specifically flagged as being friendly to new contributors.

After that, if you're looking for something a little more challenging to sink your teeth into, there's a broader [help wanted](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieBotUI/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label encompassing issues which need some love.

If you have a straightforward bug fix or improvement, feel free to contribute it in a [Pull Request](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieBotUI/pulls).

If you have an idea for a new feature, please start by [searching the issues](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieBotUI/issues) to check that the feature has not already been suggested and then suggest it by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieBotUI/issues/new), as adding new features to EddieBotUI first requires some analysis around the design and spec.

## Other ways to help

If you're not a developer there are still plenty of ways that you can help. We always need help with:

- Helping our EddieJaoudeCommunity on the [chat](https://discord.com/invite/jZQs6Wu)
- Improving the [documentation](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieBotUI/tree/develop/docs) and writing tutorials
- Testing and quality assurance
- Promoting EddieJaoudeCommunity to others by blogging, vlogging, code streaming, talking etc.
